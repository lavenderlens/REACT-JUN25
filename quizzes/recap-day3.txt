----------
1. What does the useState function return?
an array
state

2. In Object Oriented Programming such as Java, 
what might be the equivalent of what is returned in question 1?
getters - return the state

3. State must NOT be modified directly. Why?

4. Declaring a useState hook passes in an initial state. 
What datatypes may that state be?
ANYTHING
 
5. Calling a useState setter function is an async operation. 
What does that mean (general terms)
It is queued for execution on the JS event loop
ALL synchronous code must be run first

6. Is it legitimate to call useState many times in the same component?
Yes

7. What should we ideally wrap in a useEffect call?
ANYTHING apart from:
Hooks declarations
Functions
So for instance:
setIntervals
setTimeouts
Date/Time operations
localStorage
window object props such as title
EVEN console.log!

8. UseEffect has a second argument to control when it fires: what is this?
dependency array 

9. What should be in this second argument to ensure the side effect only fires ONCE, 
on component mount?
empty array

to call the CSS class(es) thereon?
